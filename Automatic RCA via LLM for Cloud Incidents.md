## **Abstract**
- Ensuring the reliability and availability of cloud servies necessitates efficient RCA for cloud incidents.
- Traditional RCA methods which relies on manual investigations of data sources such as logs, alerts and traces are often laborious, error prone and challenging.
- RCACopilit is an on-call system empowered by LLM for automating RCA of cloud incidents.
- RCACopilot matches the incoming incident handlers based on their alerts types, aggregates the critical runtime diagnostic information, predicts the incidents root cause category, and provides an explanatory narrative.
